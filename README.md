## How to Use:

Close Helldivers. If you get an error that it's still running, you may need to sign out of Windows or restart (the game didn't exit cleanly).

Grab the latest EXE from the Releases on the right-hand side. If it closes immediately, you'll need to run it with Admin privileges.
Or you can copy and paste the script manually per instructions below.
EXE [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0ed6ce60daaa1507ff288731b661273b7dfc20e0cbb8f65e430494cfcd108cc0) & [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/0ed6ce60daaa1507ff288731b661273b7dfc20e0cbb8f65e430494cfcd108cc0) link. Seems AV software hates the EXE, and Hybrid Analysis hates it even more than the PowerShell script üòÜ

 1. **Open** PowerShell (no need to run as an Administrator)
    
       ‚ö†Ô∏è If the error in the image occurs when you select the **HD2 Status Checks** option, follow the Note below.

       Note: For a few users, the script errors when running the **Get-NetFirewallRule** command-let (which only reads Firewall rules. No changes are made to the firewall).
       If this happens, you may need to run PowerShell with Administrator privileges.
       (Before opening PowerShell, right-click it and click "Run as Administrator").
       This _shouldn't_ be the norm for most users, and should be avoided unless you receive the error depicted above.
    
 3. Click on [the Hellbomb PowerShell Script](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/blob/main/Hellbomb%20Script.ps1)
 4. **Copy** entire script by clicking the copy button in the top right by the script

 6. **Paste** into PowerShell. Must use ``Ctrl`` + ``V`` (Right-clicking in terminal to paste will cause errors!).
 7. Acknowledge the warning prompt and click **Paste Anyway**
 8. Press ``Enter`` until the program runs, and the menu appears (depending on how you paste you may have to press **Enter** a couple of times)
 9. Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.
 10. Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.

## Security Info:

**VirusTotal Results:** https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ca1998c8d70a6ef9c548efebeacb56974e8bbee95b1716c98cb89973f00d4dc1

The ``Hellbomb Script.ps1`` SHA265 hash should match the VirusTotal file hash of ``ca1998c8d70a6ef9c548efebeacb56974e8bbee95b1716c98cb89973f00d4dc1``.

You can compare the File Hash to the Virus Total link to ensure that the Virus Total results match the file you're attempting to run.

1. Save the script as Hellbomb Script.ps1
2. Change to the directory where the script is saved
3. If you downloaded the .ps1 file to your Downloads folder, run ``cd $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads``
4. Run ``Get-FileHash 'Hellbomb Script.ps1' -eq ca1998c8d70a6ef9c548efebeacb56974e8bbee95b1716c98cb89973f00d4dc1``
5. The statement should return/evaluate to ``True``

**Hybrid-Analysis Link:** https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/sample/ca1998c8d70a6ef9c548efebeacb56974e8bbee95b1716c98cb89973f00d4dc1

No security software should detect the script as malicious (except KingSoft, because it ‚ù§Ô∏è false positives).
