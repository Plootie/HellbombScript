## Using the EXE:

1.) Grab the latest EXE from [the Releases on the right-hand side](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/releases) and run it. If it closes immediately, you'll need to run it with Admin privileges.

2.) Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. (``H`` is always a good place to start.) Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.

3.) Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.

## Copy and paste using Terminal Console (Manual Method)
Copy and paste the script manually per instructions below.

 1. **Open** Terminal by pressing `Windows Key` + `X` and click `Terminal`    
 2. Click on [the Hellbomb PowerShell Script](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/blob/main/Hellbomb%20Script.ps1)
 3. **Copy** entire script by clicking the copy button in the top right by the script

 4. **Paste** into Terminal. Use ``Ctrl`` + ``V`` (Right-clicking in Terminal can cause errors!).
 5. Acknowledge the warning prompt and click **Paste Anyway**
 6. Press ``Enter`` until the program runs, and the menu appears (depending on how you paste you may have to press **Enter** a couple of times)
    (If the output looks like below. Close Terminal, press `Windows Key` + `X` and click `Terminal (Admin)`. Then re-paste the script.)

       Why? For a few users, the script errors when running the **Get-NetFirewallRule** command-let which **reads** Firewall rules. No changes are made to the firewall.
       If this happens, run PowerShell with Administrator privileges.
       (Before opening PowerShell, right-click it and click "Run as Administrator").
       This _shouldn't_ be the norm for most users, and should be avoided unless you receive the error depicted above.
 8. Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. (``H`` is always a good place to start.) Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.
 9. Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.
