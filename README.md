## Using the EXE:

1.) Grab the latest EXE from the Releases on the right-hand side and run it. If it closes immediately, you'll need to run it with Admin privileges.

2.) Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. (``H`` is always a good place to start.) Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.

3.) Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.

## Using the Script in PowerShell Console (Manual Method)
Copy and paste the script manually per instructions below.

 1. **Open** PowerShell (no need to run as an Administrator unless you get lots of red text when running the **HD2 Status Checks** as depicted below)

       Why? For a few users, the script errors when running the **Get-NetFirewallRule** command-let which **reads** Firewall rules. No changes are made to the firewall.
       If this happens, run PowerShell with Administrator privileges.
       (Before opening PowerShell, right-click it and click "Run as Administrator").
       This _shouldn't_ be the norm for most users, and should be avoided unless you receive the error depicted above.
    
 3. Click on [the Hellbomb PowerShell Script](https://github.com/helldivers2fixes/HellbombScript/blob/main/Hellbomb%20Script.ps1)
 4. **Copy** entire script by clicking the copy button in the top right by the script

 6. **Paste** into PowerShell. Must use ``Ctrl`` + ``V`` (Right-clicking in terminal to paste will cause errors!).
 7. Acknowledge the warning prompt and click **Paste Anyway**
 8. Press ``Enter`` until the program runs, and the menu appears (depending on how you paste you may have to press **Enter** a couple of times)
 9. Choose a selection using the corresponding letters. Press ``Enter`` to confirm the selection.
 10. Expect Administrator prompts depending on what you're doing. Check to make sure the prompts match what you wanted to do.
